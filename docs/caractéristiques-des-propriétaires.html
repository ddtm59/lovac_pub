Figure 7.3: Types de multipropritaires par EPCI
</p>
</div>
<p>Le graphique ci-dessus montre une certaine homogénéité en termes de types de multipropriétaires sur l’ensemble des EPCI. On peut toutefois distinguer que les collectivités possédant un taux de multipropriétaires en SCVI plus important que la moyenne départementale sont encore une fois celles possédant un parc de logements plus important.</p>

Figure 7.4: Type de propriétaires et type de logements
</p>
</div>
<p>On constate que les personnes physiques ont majoritairement des maisons vacantes à la différence des autres types de propriétaires, possédant majoritairement des appartements vacants.</p>
<p>Les personnes physiques possèdent le plus de biens structurellement vacants, on peut en conclure que la part la plus importante de la vacance privée structurelle est composée de maisons individuelles possédées par des personnes physiques. On en dénombre plus de 14 000 pour le département.</p>

<p>On peut classer les âges des propriétaires en trois grandes catégories :</p>
<ul>
<li>les moins de 40 ans, soit légèrement au dessus de l’âge médian du premier achat ;</li>
<li>les plus de 75 ans ;</li>
<li>le reste des propriétaires.</li>

<p>Ces catégories sont bien entendu discutables, mais ont le bénéfice de permettre une meilleure appréhension des phénomènes associés.</p>

Figure 7.5: Répartition des logements en fonction de l’âge des propriétaires
</p>
</div>
<p>On constate que près de 40% des logements sont détenus par des personnes ayant plus de 60 ans. Seuls 10% des logements sont détenus par des personnes âgées de moins de 40 ans.</p>
<p>Les leviers actionnables pour lutter contre la vacance ne sont pas aussi efficaces en fonction des catégories d’âge des propriétaires. On note toutefois que l’écrasante majorité des propriétaire (73%) ont entre 40 et 75 ans.</p>
<p>On peut de nouveau mener l’analyse pour chaque EPCI. On observe ainsi quelques variations entre les EPCI, mais on constate que le phénomène est similaire sur l’ensemble du département.</p>

</div>
<p>On constate une répartition différente des âges. En effet, à l’exception des moins de 40 ans, les rapports de forces ont changé en faveur des catégories les plus âgées. Ainsi, plus de la moitié des multipropriétaires ont plus de 60 ans et près d’un quart ont plus de 75 ans.</p>

<p>Au regard des données à disposition on peut constater que le niveau de confort varie en fonction de l’âge des propriétaires. Le rapport entre les logements “confortables” et “inconfortables” est en faveur des logements “inconfortables” pour les âges les plus avancés comme l’illustre le graphique suivant.</p>
